Script that allows you to easily save lockscreen wallpapers from windows spotlight.
Moves all files from windows spotlight folder in appdata to current folder that script is located, and renames them so you can open them as images.

Just move main.py to folder when you want to store images and run it as script

At this moment it only work for folders of system drive (C:)
